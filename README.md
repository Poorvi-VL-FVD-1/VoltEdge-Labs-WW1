## Employee Workflow in a Project

Employees typically follow a standard workflow when contributing to a project:

## Clone the Repository
Employees make a local copy of the project repository using the `git clone` command. This allows them to work offline and test changes locally.

## Create a Branch
Instead of working directly on the main codebase, a new branch is created for each feature or bug fix. This isolates changes and prevents breaking the main project.

## Make and Commit Changes
Employees make the required changes, test them locally, and use `git add` and `git commit` to save the changes with descriptive messages.

## Push Changes
The committed changes are pushed to the remote GitHub repository using the `git push` command.

## Open a Pull Request (PR)
A pull request is opened to propose merging the feature branch into the main branch. The PR acts as a discussion platform for the proposed changes.

## Code Review
Team members review the pull request, provide feedback, and suggest improvements to ensure code quality.

## Merge
Once approved and all checks pass, the changes are merged into the main branch and become part of the project.
